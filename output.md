     ‚Üí "**Evidence:**

"The city's police department released official crime statistics for 2023 showing a 15% increase in reported violent crimes (homicides, robberies, aggravated assaults) compared to the average of the previous five years (2018-2022). Property crime (burglaries, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft) also saw a 10% increase in the same period."

**Explanation of Why This is Supporting Evidence:**

*   **Specific:** The evidence refers to a concrete source (the city's police department) and specific types of crimes (violent and property).
*   **Realistic:** Police departments routinely collect and release crime statistics.
*   **Quantifiable:** It provides percentage increases (15% and 10%), making the change in crime rates measurable.
*   **Comparative:** Comparing the 2023 statistics to a five-year average gives context and indicates that the increase is not just a random fluctuation but a potentially meaningful trend."

  1. [add_premise] Score: 0.63
     Add supporting evidence for c1
     ‚Üí "A longitudinal study tracking a large sample of children and adolescents over several years, specifically measuring their video game habits (types of games played, frequency, duration) and monitoring their levels of aggressive behavior (physical altercations, bullying, verbal aggression) as reported by themselves, parents, teachers, and potentially legal records.

**Specifically, evidence supporting the claim would be:**

*   A statistically significant positive correlation between the amount of time spent playing violent video games (rated M for Mature) and the frequency of aggressive incidents reported by multiple sources (self, parents, teachers) over the longitudinal study period. This correlation would need to control for other potential contributing factors such as pre-existing aggressive tendencies, family environment, and peer influences. Additionally, if the study uses statistical methods (e.g., cross-lagged panel analysis) to suggest that violent video game playing *precedes* increases in aggression (rather than just being correlated at the same time), this would be stronger evidence of a causal relationship."

  1. [add_premise] Score: 0.54
     Add bridging premise to connect existing claims to c3
     ‚Üí "Here's a bridging premise that makes the argument valid (though not necessarily sound or ethical):

*   **Bridging Premise:** If someone advocates for a position and engages in illegal or disruptive actions related to that position, their arguments should be dismissed regardless of their merit.

**Explanation**

The premise connects the *action* (Dr. Johnson's arrest) to the *argument* (for climate action). It asserts a general rule that allows us to dismiss someone's arguments based solely on their actions, specifically illegal or disruptive actions related to the argument's subject.

**Important Considerations**

*   **Validity vs. Soundness:** This premise makes the argument *logically valid* because *IF* the premise is true, and the premises are true, then the conclusion *must* be true. However, the premise itself is highly questionable. It's a form of ad hominem, attacking the person rather than the argument.
*   **Alternative Interpretations:** Many people would disagree with this bridging premise. They might argue that a person's actions, even illegal ones, don't necessarily invalidate their arguments."

     ‚Üí "Okay, this is a challenging request since the claim is widely considered a slippery slope fallacy and lacks a strong basis in reality. However, to *attempt* to provide supporting evidence, we would need to demonstrate a causal link or a significant correlation. Here's a hypothetical (and unlikely) piece of evidence:

*   **Hypothetical Study:** A longitudinal study tracking societal attitudes and behaviors related to marriage and relationships in countries that legalized same-sex marriage. This study would need to demonstrate a *statistically significant* increase in:

    1.  **Public expressions of support for bestiality:** Measured through surveys assessing attitudes towards animal-human relationships, legalizing bestiality, or granting animals rights similar to spouses.
    2.  **Reported incidents of bestiality:** Collected through law enforcement records, animal welfare organizations, and public health databases. The study would need to show a rise in these incidents *specifically after* the legalization of same-sex marriage, controlling for other factors like changes in reporting practices or increased awareness of animal abuse.
    3.  **Attempts to legally recognize animal-human unions:** Documented through court cases, legislative proposals, or public campaigns advocating for the legal recognition of marriage or civil partnerships between humans and animals.

The study would need to establish that the increase in these factors is significantly greater in countries or regions that have legalized same-sex marriage compared to those that have not, while also controlling for other potentially confounding variables (e.g., changes in internet access, cultural shifts in attitudes towards animals independent of marriage laws). Furthermore, it would need to demonstrate that the timing of these increases closely follows the legalization of same-sex marriage, suggesting a causal relationship rather than a mere coincidence.

**Important Note:** Even with such a study, establishing a *causal* link would be incredibly difficult. Correlation does not equal causation. It's far more likely that any observed changes would be attributable to other societal factors or independent trends in attitudes towards animals, sexuality, and relationships. This hypothetical evidence is provided solely to address the prompt, not to endorse the claim's validity."

     ‚Üí "**Evidence:**

*   **Empirical Claim:** A study demonstrating a statistically significant correlation between bestiality and increased rates of animal abuse, neglect, or suffering in regions where bestiality is legal or tolerated.

**Details**
If there are higher rates of animal abuse or neglect where bestiality is legal or tolerated, then society may have legitimate concerns about this practice. If there are no such negative consequences, it becomes much harder to claim there is any justification for restrictions."
