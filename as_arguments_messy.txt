We should adopt downtown congestion pricing to cut gridlock and fund faster buses.

ID: M2
Customers will avoid downtown if you charge them to enter; small shops will be the first to suffer.

ID: M3
That fear didn’t pan out elsewhere: London, Stockholm, and Singapore saw traffic fall and retail recover, with revenue reinvested in transit.

ID: M4
The buses are unreliable as-is. Charging drivers before fixing transit is backwards.

ID: M5
The proposal includes off-peak discounts for delivery vans and a low-income rebate—both aimed at fairness concerns.

ID: M6
A flat fee is regressive; it hits lower-wage commuters harder than executives.

ID: M7
Skipping any fee keeps pollution concentrated near schools; we already exceed safe NO₂ levels on many days.

ID: M8
Congestion dropped ~30% during lockdowns without any fee. Traffic is easing as more people hybrid-work—fees are unnecessary now.

ID: M9
Even modest peak pricing shifts marginal trips. Ring-fenced revenue for bus lanes and signal priority compounds those gains.

ID: M10
Businesses rely on just-in-time deliveries; toll checkpoints will create new queues and delays.

ID: M11
There are no “checkpoints”: ALPR cameras and dynamic pricing bill post-trip—no barrier queues.

ID: M12
Or we could just tweak parking rates by time-of-day. No need to invent a new bureaucracy.

ID: M13
Pilot first: 6 months, audited metrics, and opt-out blocks if targets aren’t met. That de-risks the rollout.

ID: M14
Ring-fenced? Please. Politicians always raid the pot for pet projects; the transit fund won’t be different.

ID: M15
State law requires a dedicated transit trust, and last year’s audit confirmed compliance; raiding it isn’t legal.

ID: M16
Delivery drivers can’t eat the fee. Margins are razor-thin; this is unfair.

ID: M17
Exemptions gut the policy: once you hand them out for vans and special cases, nobody actually pays.

ID: M18
Not so—the fee still applies to most single-occupancy commuter trips at peaks; that’s the bulk of traffic.

ID: M19
Tourists will balk at paying to visit; downtown hospitality will take the hit.

ID: M20
A small peak parking fee won’t deter day visitors; hotels already charge more. Major museums endorsed the plan after seeing weekend exemptions.
