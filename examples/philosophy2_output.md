## EXAMPLE 1
Argument: No belief is rationally justified.
But if that's true, then the belief 'no belief is rationally justified' is itself not justified.
So if skepticism is true, we shouldn't believe skepticism.
Therefore, skepticism defeats itself.

## EXAMPLE 2
Argument: Someone with $1 million is rich.
If someone with $X is rich, then someone with $X - 1 is also rich.
(After all, one dollar can't make the difference between rich and not-rich!)
Therefore, someone with $999,999 is rich.
By repeated application: someone with $1 is rich.
But that's absurd - so our concept of 'rich' is incoherent.

## EXAMPLE 3
Argument: It's possible that a maximally great being exists.
A maximally great being would have necessary existence (exists in all possible worlds).
If it's possible that a necessary being exists, then that being exists in at least one possible world.
But if a necessary being exists in any possible world, it exists in all possible worlds.
Therefore, a maximally great being exists in the actual world.

## EXAMPLE 4
Argument: Some people claim 'there is no objective truth.'
But this claim itself purports to be objectively true.
For any meaningful debate to occur, participants must assume that some statements are objectively true or false.
Even to argue against objective truth requires assuming objective standards of logic and evidence.
Therefore, the very possibility of rational discourse presupposes objective truth.
