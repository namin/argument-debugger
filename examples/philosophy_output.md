## EXAMPLE 1
Argument: I think, therefore I am. I cannot doubt that I am thinking, for doubting is itself a form of thinking. Even if an evil demon deceives me about everything else, he cannot deceive me about my existence while I am thinking. Therefore, my existence as a thinking being is the most certain knowledge possible.

## EXAMPLE 2
Argument: The unexamined life is not worth living. Those who never reflect on their actions live like animals, driven by instinct rather than reason. Reason is what distinguishes humans from beasts. A life without philosophy is therefore not truly human. Since a non-human life has no value for a human being, the unexamined life is not worth living.

## EXAMPLE 3
Argument: If God exists, then evil should not exist. God is by definition omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. An omnipotent being can prevent all evil. An omniscient being knows about all evil. An omnibenevolent being wants to prevent all evil. Yet evil clearly exists in the world. Therefore, God does not exist.

## EXAMPLE 4
Argument: We cannot have knowledge of the external world. All our knowledge comes through our senses. Our senses sometimes deceive us, as in dreams or hallucinations. If our senses can deceive us sometimes, they might be deceiving us always. We cannot prove we're not being deceived right now. Therefore, we cannot know anything about the external world with certainty.

## EXAMPLE 5
Argument: Every event must have a cause. If every event has a cause, then the first event must have had a cause. But what caused the cause of the first event? This leads to an infinite regress. An infinite regress is impossible. Therefore, there must be an uncaused first cause, which we call God.

## EXAMPLE 6
Argument: We have no free will. Every action is either determined by prior causes or random. If our actions are determined, we don't have free will. If our actions are random, we don't have control over them, so we don't have free will. Our actions must be either determined or random. Therefore, we have no free will.

Argument: The mind cannot be identical to the brain. I can doubt that my brain exists - perhaps I'm a brain in a vat being stimulated to think I have a body. But I cannot doubt that my mind exists, as doubting requires a mind. If I can doubt one but not the other, they cannot be identical. Therefore, the mind and brain are distinct.

## EXAMPLE 8
Argument: Morality is relative to culture. Different cultures have different moral codes. There is no objective way to judge between different moral codes.

## EXAMPLE 10
Argument: We should maximize happiness for the greatest number. Actions are right when they produce happiness and wrong when they produce suffering. The best action is the one that produces the most happiness overall. This is an objective measure that doesn't depend on personal feelings or cultural norms. Therefore, morality consists in maximizing total happiness.

## EXAMPLE 12
Argument: Personal identity persists through change. The ship of Theseus has all its parts gradually replaced.

## EXAMPLE 13
Argument: Nothing exists except ideas in minds. We only ever perceive our own ideas or sensations. We never perceive material objects directly, only our ideas of them. There is no reason to suppose material objects exist beyond our ideas. A simpler explanation is that only minds and ideas exist. Therefore, material objects are just collections of ideas.

## EXAMPLE 16
Argument: You should act only according to maxims you could will to be universal laws. If everyone lied, communication would break down and lying would become impossible. Lying therefore involves a contradiction when universalized. Actions that lead to contradictions when universalized are immoral. Therefore, lying is always wrong, regardless of consequences.
