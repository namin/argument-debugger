## EXAMPLE 2
Argument: Even though there have been no other instances of resurrection recorded throughout history, Jesus's resurrection was real because it is well-documented that he performed miracles. Only God can perform miracles, so Jesus was God. And God can do all things, including resurrecting himself.

üîß GENERATING REPAIR...

REPAIR COMMENTARY:
Here are some possible one-liners to address the issues, keeping the tone neutral and changes minimal:

*   This slippery slope argument suggests that if the traditional definition of marriage is expanded to include same-sex couples, then there would be no logical basis to prevent further, more extreme redefinitions.
*   The concern is that removing the gender-based restriction on marriage could logically weaken the framework for other restrictions, potentially leading to calls for marriage with non-human entities or multiple partners.
*   Proponents of this view argue that redefining marriage to include same-sex couples sets a precedent that could erode the traditional boundaries of the institution, making it difficult to justify any remaining restrictions.

REPAIR COMMENTARY:
Here's a revised version of the argument with the requested additions:

* Sam has met 100 redheads in his life. This count is based on Sam's personal recollection and a review of his social media contacts.
* 50 of those redheads were missing thumbs. This observation was made by Sam during his interactions with them.
* Therefore all redheads are missing thumbs.

CLEAN ARGUMENT:
Sam has met 100 redheads in his life, per his personal recollection and a review of his social media contacts. 50 of those redheads were missing thumbs, an observation made by Sam during his interactions with them. This significant proportion of thumb-missing redheads in Sam's experience leads him to conclude that all redheads are missing thumbs.

REPAIR COMMENTARY:
Here are the proposed additions to address the issues:

*   Jake has always arrived to work by bus. *This is confirmed by his consistent bus pass usage records over the past five years.*
*   However, today, the bus service was suspended. *The local transit authority announced the suspension due to severe weather conditions.*

CLEAN ARGUMENT:
Jake has always arrived to work by bus, as confirmed by his consistent bus pass usage records over the past five years. However, today, the bus service was suspended; the local transit authority announced the suspension due to severe weather conditions. Since his sole method of transportation, the bus, is unavailable, it is therefore impossible for Jake to get to work.
