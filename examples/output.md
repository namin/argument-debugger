Here's a bulleted list of suggested additions/modifications to address the issues:

*   "For instance, the Old Testament recounts the Flood, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and numerous instances of divine retribution against enemies of Israel."
*   "Furthermore, passages like Deuteronomy 7:1-2 describe God commanding the Israelites to utterly destroy the inhabitants of Canaan, and Numbers 31 details the slaughter of Midianites, including women and children, at God's instruction."
*   "Alternatively, God might exist but operate under principles of justice or a divine plan that humans cannot fully comprehend, or perhaps the biblical accounts are allegorical or subject to interpretation."

CLEAN ARGUMENT:
Either God does not exist or God is not benevolent. The Bible tells many stories of God being cruel, instructing his people to be cruel, and even condoning cruelty. For instance, the Old Testament recounts the Flood, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, and numerous instances of divine retribution against enemies of Israel. Furthermore, passages like Deuteronomy 7:1-2 describe God commanding the Israelites to utterly destroy the inhabitants of Canaan, and Numbers 31 details the slaughter of Midianites, including women and children, at God's instruction. Alternatively, God might exist but operate under principles of justice or a divine plan that humans cannot fully comprehend, or perhaps the biblical accounts are allegorical or subject to interpretation. These biblical accounts, as recorded in the Old Testament, suggest a God whose actions are inconsistent with benevolence, leading to the conclusion that either God does not exist or God is not benevolent.

Here's a repair of the argument with minimal changes:

* Crime rates have increased in our city, as evidenced by recent police department statistics showing a 15% rise in reported incidents over the last year.

CLEAN ARGUMENT:
Crime rates have increased in our city, as evidenced by recent police department statistics showing a 15% rise in reported incidents over the last year. This rise in crime suggests a need for increased law enforcement presence to deter criminal activity and improve public safety. Therefore, we need to hire more police officers.

Here's a light-touch repair of the argument, addressing the evidence gaps with minimal changes:

*   Studies have shown a correlation between prolonged exposure to violent video games and increased aggressive thoughts or behaviors in some individuals.
*   Surveys indicate that a significant majority of children in many countries regularly engage with video games.

CLEAN ARGUMENT:
Studies have shown a correlation between prolonged exposure to violent video games and increased aggressive thoughts or behaviors in some individuals. Surveys indicate that a significant majority of children in many countries regularly engage with video games. Given this established correlation and widespread engagement, it follows that video games cause violence. Therefore, we should ban video games for children.

* Global temperatures are rising, as evidenced by data from organizations like NASA and NOAA showing a consistent upward trend over the past century.

CLEAN ARGUMENT:
Global temperatures are rising, as evidenced by data from organizations like NASA and NOAA showing a consistent upward trend over the past century. This rise in global temperatures is largely attributed to human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. To mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and reduce our reliance on these harmful energy sources, we should invest in renewable energy.

CLEAN ARGUMENT:
All politicians are corrupt.

REPAIR COMMENTARY:
Here's a list of proposed one-liners to address the issues, keeping the changes minimal and the tone neutral:

*   **c1 evidence:** "Some economic models suggest that current spending levels on social programs, if unchecked, could lead to unsustainable debt burdens."
*   **c2 evidence:** "Economic collapses are historically associated with widespread unemployment, poverty, and social unrest."
*   **Reframe dichotomy:** "While cutting social programs is one proposed solution, other options include increasing revenue through taxation, stimulating economic growth, or reallocating existing government funds."

CLEAN ARGUMENT:
Either we cut social programs or the economy will collapse. Some economic models suggest that current spending levels on social programs, if unchecked, could lead to unsustainable debt burdens. Economic collapses are historically associated with widespread unemployment, poverty, and social unrest, per historical records. While cutting social programs is one proposed solution, other options include increasing revenue through taxation, stimulating economic growth, or reallocating existing government funds. We cannot let the economy collapse. Therefore, we must cut social programs.
