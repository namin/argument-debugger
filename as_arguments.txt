We should adopt a 3-day in-office policy to boost collaboration and team cohesion.

Fully remote work reduces commute time and often increases productivity for focused tasks.

Mandating office days harms inclusion for caregivers and colleagues with long commutes.

Creative brainstorm quality drops when everyone is remote; in-person sessions yield better idea diversity.

Providing travel stipends and flexible hours mitigates commute and caregiving concerns.

We should not adopt a 3-day in-office policy; make it optional instead.

Purely optional attendance leads to knowledge silos; a minimal in-office cadence prevents team drift.
