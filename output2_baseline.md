## EXAMPLE 1
Argument: John Smith wrote a book that provided a lot of evidence for the earth flat. John Smith sold a billion copies of his book. The information and evidence convinced all one billion people. Therefore, the earth is flat.

üîç ISSUES FOUND:
  - unsupported_premise: The premise that John Smith's book provided 'a lot of evidence for the earth flat' is an unsupported premise. The existence of a book claiming something does not make its contents evidence, nor does it validate the quality or truthfulness of that 'evidence'.
  - unsupported_premise: The premise that 'The information and evidence convinced all one billion people' is an unsupported premise. There is no justification or evidence provided that all one billion people who bought the book were actually convinced by its contents.
  - missing_link: The conclusion 'Therefore, the earth is flat' does not logically follow from the premises. The popularity of a book or the number of people it supposedly convinced does not make its claims true. This is an appeal to popularity, which is a logical fallacy.

## EXAMPLE 2
Argument: Even though there have been no other instances of resurrection recorded throughout history, Jesus's resurrection was real because it is well-documented that he performed miracles. Only God can perform miracles, so Jesus was God. And God can do all things, including resurrecting himself.

üîç ISSUES FOUND:
  - missing_link: The argument claims Jesus's resurrection was real because he performed miracles, but performing miracles does not logically necessitate resurrection. There is a missing link between performing miracles and the specific act of resurrection.
  - unsupported_premise: The premise 'it is well-documented that he performed miracles' is stated without any supporting evidence or reference to what constitutes this documentation.
  - unsupported_premise: The premise 'Only God can perform miracles' is presented as a fact without any justification or evidence.
  - missing_link: The argument concludes 'Jesus was God' because 'Only God can perform miracles' and 'he performed miracles'. While this might be a common theological inference, it's a missing link in a purely logical sense without further premises connecting miracle performance uniquely to divinity.
  - missing_link: The argument states 'God can do all things, including resurrecting himself' and uses this to support Jesus's resurrection. The leap from 'God can do all things' to 'God can resurrect himself' is a specific interpretation, and the connection to Jesus's resurrection relies on the unstated assumption that Jesus is indeed God, which is itself a conclusion drawn within the argument.

## EXAMPLE 3
Argument: Marriage should be restricted to one man and one woman. Gay people should not be allowed to get married because if you allow two men or two women to get married, then why wouldn't you allow a man to marry a goat or a chair or 15 chickens?

üîç ISSUES FOUND:
  - slippery_slope: The argument claims that allowing same-sex marriage will inevitably lead to allowing marriage with animals or inanimate objects, without providing any logical justification for this progression.
  - unsupported_premise: The premise that marriage 'should be restricted to one man and one woman' is stated as a given without any supporting evidence or reasoning.

## EXAMPLE 4
Argument: I cant imagine how something can come from nothing, therefore a creator God must have created the universe.

üîç ISSUES FOUND:
  - missing_link: The conclusion that a creator God must have created the universe does not logically follow from the premise that the arguer cannot imagine how something can come from nothing. There are other potential explanations or unknown mechanisms that are not considered.
  - false_dichotomy: The argument presents a false dichotomy by implying that if something cannot come from nothing (as imagined by the arguer), then the only alternative is a creator God. It ignores other possibilities or scientific theories about the origin of the universe.

## EXAMPLE 5
Argument: Sam has met 100 redheads in his life. 50 of those redheads were missing thumbs. Therefore all readheads are missing thumbs.

üîç ISSUES FOUND:
  - missing_link: The conclusion that all redheads are missing thumbs does not logically follow from the premise that 50 out of 100 redheads Sam met were missing thumbs. This is an unjustified generalization from a limited sample.

## EXAMPLE 6
Argument: Jake has always arrived to work by bus. However, today, the bus service was suspended. It is therefore impossible for Jake to get to work.

üîç ISSUES FOUND:
  - false_dichotomy: The argument assumes that if Jake cannot take the bus, he has no other means of getting to work. This presents only two options (bus or no work) when other possibilities like walking, cycling, carpooling, or taking a taxi might exist.
  - missing_link: The conclusion that it is impossible for Jake to get to work does not logically follow from the premises. The argument assumes that the bus is Jake's *only* way to get to work, which is an unstated and unsupported assumption.
